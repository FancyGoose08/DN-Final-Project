                    <p>
                        Older adults often struggle to accomplish essential tasks, but limited digital skills and lack
                        of ongoing support are causing them to become increasingly excluded in a world that is becoming
                        increasingly reliant on technology.

                    <h2>Who does this affect?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In our problem statement, we mention "older adults." To be more specific, "older adults" is
                        referencing elderly people ages 65 or older. Since we work in Everett, we see a lot of elderly
                        people in this age group and we assist a lot of these people while doing our Digital Navigator
                        work.

                    <h2>What are they trying to do?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As adults get older, they get more complicated medical issues that require a doctor's attention. These adults or their caretakers need a way to get in touch with their doctors as things progress in either direction and doctors and pharmacies need a way to get in touch with their patients when they have important information for them. E-health services can make keeping track of all that and telehealth can make getting in touch with a doctor easier than ever.

                    <h2>What is getting in the way?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A couple things are getting in the way of this goal:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Elderly people's avoidance to modern technologies, and</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>quickly advancing tech and e-health technologies.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Technology is getting more and more powerful with every passing year. This causes older adults, especially those more set in their ways, to be wary and avoid technologies that can help them. A peer-reviewed paper mentions their findings on older adults and their opinions on modern technology.

                    <p>
                        "To many [elderly adults], technology might cause anxiety due to a low level of comfort with and control of technology, age-related cognitive difficulties (eg, less attentiveness, psychomotor slowing), or a lack of familiarity."

                    <p>
                        Advancing technology is causing healthcare to advance their tech as well. A paper published on
                        the <span>National Library of Medicine</span> says:
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote">
                        "The development of telemedicine, the further enhancement of digital security and the
                        strengthening of technological information systems will contribute to the universal acceptance
                        of the digital health transformation by all involved."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize, this is saying that as technology advances, telemedicine and digital healthcare
                        services will advance with it.

                    <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
                    <p>
                        People, not just elderly people, are proven to be healthier when they know how to use e-health resources and other essential technologies. A paper published on the <span>Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) Publications</span> shared their findings after doing a survery on elderly people and their health and knowledge on e-health services. They found that:

                    <p class="quote">
                        "Respondents with lower self-rated health had lower levels of digital health literacy; only 54.2% participants with poor self-rated health were able to send a message to their doctor compared to 89.5% of patients with excellent self-rated health."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This shows our aformentioned point. People are approximately <span>65% healthier</span> when they know how to send a message to their doctor using e-health services.
